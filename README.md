# Blender 3D Reaper DX Addon

Allows you to extract scaling from the ripped `.obj` files. Supports Blender 2.83+

## Usage

Import the `.obj`, but make sure you check `Split by Group` under the `Geometery` Tab. Then go to the right option panel, click on `3D Ripper DX`, select the source `.obj` again there, import and adjust scalings.

Textures can be fixed by simply setting the `Texture Path` and then clicking `Fix Textures`
