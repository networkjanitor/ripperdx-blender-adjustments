# Blender 3D Reaper DX Addon

Allows you to extract scaling from the ripped `.obj` files. Supports Blender 2.83+

## Usage

Import the `.obj` as usual. Then go to the right option panel, click on `3D Ripper DX`, select the source `.obj` again there, import and adjust scalings.

The same can be done for broken textures.
